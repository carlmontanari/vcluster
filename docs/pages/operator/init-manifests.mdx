title: Applying manifests on initialization
sidebar_label: Applying manifests on init
---

Starting in version 0.8.0, vcluster allows users to apply manifests as soon as the vcluster is started. This can be useful for users configuring internal vcluster resources.

This can be configured via `helm` values:

```yaml
init:
  manifests: |-
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    ...
    ---
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ConfigMap
    ...
```

Starting in version 0.10.2, vcluster cli also allows users to pass filenames of manifests that
should be added to the vcluster helm chart values. These manifests will be deployed into the
vcluster in the same way that they would when using helm. The `--init` flag is used to pass
manifest filenames and can be used as follows:

```
vcluster create my-vcluster -n my-vcluster --init='/some/file/path/manifest.yaml,~/somemanifest.
yaml'
```
